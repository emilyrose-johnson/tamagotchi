*Authors: Emily Johnson, Jack Parker, Rowan Murphy and Chloe McQuin* 
### Description:
Users are able to select one of three pets and name their new friend. As time goes on, the pet will age and grow just like you. In order to keep your pet happy
and healthy, use the left and right buttons at the bottom to scroll between the care funtions. If one of the health bars is low, click the middle button when the 
selector is over that funtion. Just like that, the health bar will raise and make your pet happy again. When you want to leave the game, you're able to save your 
progress through the in-game menu. When you come back, you might notice your pet has aged and might need some care to be happy again!
